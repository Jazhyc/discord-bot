## Details

A Simple Chatbot in Python that uses discord's and several other APIs which is capable of telling the Weather, Searching up things on Wikipedia, streaming Audio from Youtube, hosting a quiz session on various anime openings with a persisting leader board and various other tasks.

Like other bots, all actions occur asynchronously. This bot is currently hosted on heroku and uses a Postgres SQL server to remember details between the resets of the worker dynamo.

As time goes on, I will be adding more features to this bot. Feel free to invite it to your discord server using the below link.
Don't hesitate to mention any features that you would like to be added to this bot.
